# PSO 'Notum' Highres Hud Font
Fan-made High Resolution HUD Font Mod for Phantasy Star Online Ep. I&II (& Plus).

Notum is based on the Dotum font.

This repo only provides font-related textures though they mesh well with my somewhat faithful [PSOGC HD UI Mod](https://github.com/eleriaqueen/pso-highres-ui).

_Compatible with Dolphin emulator only_
